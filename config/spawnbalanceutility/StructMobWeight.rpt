* This is the StructMobWeight report file that is output every time the server starts.
* 
* Spawn Balance Utility (SBU) will use this file ONLY if it is renamed to StructMobWeight.csv.
* Lines starting with '*' are comments and ignored
* It allows you to add and remove mobs and adjust their spawnweights for Structures
* like shipwrecks, nether fortresses, water monuments, etc.
